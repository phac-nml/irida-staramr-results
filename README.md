# IRIDA StarAMR Results

IRIDA StarAMR Results program enables StarAMR analysis results that were run through IRIDA to be downloaded into a spreadsheet using the command line. 

## Running from source code

1. __Clone the repository:__
   ```
   > git clone https://github.com/phac-nml/irida-staramr-results.git
   ```

2. __Install and build the Project__
   ```
   > cd irida-staramr-results
   > make
   > source .virtualenv/bin/activate
   ```
  

3. __Configuration for IRIDA REST API:__
   - You will need to create a client in IRIDA. Refer to [IRIDA client configuration](https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/user/administrator/#managing-system-clients) guide for more details.
   - You will need to create your own configuration file in YAML. Refer to [example-config.yml](example-config.yml) for more information on how to format the file.
    
        #### Config Fields:
    
        - `base-url`: The server URL to download results from. If you navigate to your instance of IRIDA in your web browser, the URL (after youâ€™ve logged in) will often look like: https://irida.corefacility.ca/irida/. The URL you should enter into the Server URL field is that URL, with api/ at the end. So in the case of https://irida.corefacility.ca/irida/, you should enter the URL https://irida.corefacility.ca/irida/api/
        - `client-id`: The id from the IRIDA client you created
        - `client-secret`: The id from the IRIDA client you created
