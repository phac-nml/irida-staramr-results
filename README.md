# Setup
### Python
   IRIDA StarAMR Results requires **Python version 3.8 or later**. Check the Python version you are using with:
   ```
   $ python --version
   ```

### Configuration for IRIDA REST API

- You will need to have a client instance in IRIDA.
  - Only IRIDA administrators can create client instances. Users should contact their IRIDA admin for client credentials.
  - Refer to [IRIDA client configuration](https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/user/administrator/#managing-system-clients) guide for more details.
- You will need to create your own configuration file in YAML. Here is an [example](./example-config.yml).

  #### Fields:

  - `base-url`: The server URL to download results from. If you navigate to your instance of IRIDA in your web browser, the URL (after youâ€™ve logged in) will often look like: https://irida.corefacility.ca/irida/. The URL you should enter into the Server URL field is that URL, with api/ at the end. So in the case of https://irida.corefacility.ca/irida/, you should enter the URL https://irida.corefacility.ca/irida/api/
  - `client-id`: The id from the IRIDA client you created
  - `client-secret`: The id from the IRIDA client you created
